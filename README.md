## 📘 About this project

This project represents a final practice app, where I applied fundamental techniques in **Flutter development** — including UI building, Firebase integration, and cross-platform responsiveness.

After working extensively with **iOS (Swift, SwiftUI)**,  
this app marks a practical step in expanding my skillset into the Flutter ecosystem.
